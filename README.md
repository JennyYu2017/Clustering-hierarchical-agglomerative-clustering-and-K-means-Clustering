# ML: Clustering: Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering and K-means Clustering
In this assignment, I implemented the two types of clustering methods, Lloyd’s algorithm (“k-means”) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering, on two datasets to compare the prons and cons based on the clustering results.

• K-means Clustering: applied two different initialization methods(uniform random and k-means++) and implemented the k-means clustering from scratch.

• Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering: used two dissimilarity measures between clusters(single linkage and average linkage) to implement the hierarchical clustering with skilearn.
