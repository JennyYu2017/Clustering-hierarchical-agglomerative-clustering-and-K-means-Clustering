# ML: Clustering: Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering and K-means Clustering
In this assignment, I implemented the two types of clustering methods, Lloyd’s algorithm (“k-means”) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering, on two datasets.

• The first dataset consists of 3500 two-dimensional examples. These examples were generated by a
Gaussian mixture model.

• The second dataset, dataset2.csv, consists of 14,801 three-dimensional examples.
